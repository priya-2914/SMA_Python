Can Table have more than one primary key?
A table can have only one primary key, but that primary key can be composite, meaning it can include multiple columns.
Composite (or Compound) Primary Key — Allowed
A single primary key made of multiple columns is allowed.
This is still one primary key, just using more than one column.
Example:-
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
  student_id INT,
  course_id INT,
  enroll_date DATE,
  PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
-----------------------------------
Distinct: used to remove duplicate rows from the result set and return only unique values.
Example:-
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;

-If there are multiple columns uniqueness is checked on the combination of columns, not individually.
Example:- 
SELECT DISTINCT department, job_title
FROM employees;
Result contains only one hr and manager
HR, Manager
HR, Analyst
HR, Manager  ---duplicate row

DISTINCT with COUNT:-
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department)
FROM employees;
Counts how many unique departments exist.

DISTINCT with NULLs:-
Multiple NULL values are treated as one
If many rows have NULL, only one NULL appears.
Distinct Vs Group by :-These two are similar but not the same
DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;
GROUP BY
SELECT department
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
Same result here
GROUP BY is better when using aggregates like SUM, AVG, etc.
---------------------------------------------
Count: An aggregate function used to count rows.
1.	Count(*)- counts all rows including nulls
2.	Count(col_name)- Counts non-NULL values in that column.
3.	Count(Distinct col_name)- Counts unique, non-NULL values.
4.	Count with multiple columns are not allowed but COUNT(DISTINCT col1, col2) is allowed. It counts unique combination of col1 and col2.
Limit: used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query.
LIMIT with OFFSET:- 
SELECT *
FROM employees
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;
Meaning:
•	Skip first 10 rows
•	Return next 5 rows
-----------------------------------------------------------
SQl operators: 
•	Arithmetic → + - * / %
•	Comparison → =, !=, <, >, <=, >=
•	Logical → AND, OR, NOT
•	Special → IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL, EXISTS
------------------------------------------
Group by and Having:
GROUP BY
•	Purpose: Aggregate rows based on one or more columns.
•	Used with: Aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN().
Example:
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
Result: Number of employees per department.
HAVING
•	Purpose: Filter groups after aggregation.
•	Difference with WHERE:
o	WHERE filters rows before aggregation
o	HAVING filters groups after aggregation
Example:
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
Result: Only departments with more than 10 employees.
Difference between where clause and having:
Feature	WHERE	HAVING
Purpose	 Filters rows before grouping	       Filters groups after grouping
Used with	 Columns (no aggregates)	      Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT…)
Executed	 Before GROUP BY	      After GROUP BY
Example	 WHERE salary > 30000	   HAVING COUNT(*) > 10.  
WHERE → row filter, HAVING → group filter
