Hadoop:
Hadoop is a framework for storing and processing very large datasets across clusters of computers in a distributed way.
Hadoop Architecture Overview
Hadoop has two main layers:
HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) – Storage layer
MapReduce / YARN – Processing layer

1.HDFS – Storage Layer
HDFS stores data across multiple nodes (computers) in a cluster.
Components:
Component	- Role
NameNode	- Master node that keeps metadata (file names, blocks, locations)
DataNode	- Worker nodes that store actual data blocks
Secondary NameNode	- Backup for NameNode metadata (not a live failover)

Files are split into blocks (default 128 MB)
Blocks are replicated (default 3 copies) for fault tolerance
Ensures data is not lost if a node fails

2.YARN – Resource & Processing Layer
YARN = Yet Another Resource Negotiator
It manages resources and job scheduling in the cluster.
Components:
Component	Role
ResourceManager (RM)	Master: assigns resources to applications
NodeManager (NM)	Worker: manages resources on each node
ApplicationMaster (AM)	Manages lifecycle of each job (like a MapReduce job)

3.MapReduce – Processing Layer
MapReduce is Hadoop’s original processing framework:
Map phase – processes input data and produces intermediate key-value pairs
Shuffle & Sort phase – groups data by key
Reduce phase – aggregates results into final output
Example: Counting words in a text file
Map → (“Hadoop”, 1), (“Hadoop”, 1), (“Data”, 1)
Shuffle → group by key → (“Hadoop”, [1,1]), (“Data”, [1])
Reduce → sum counts → (“Hadoop”, 2), (“Data”, 1)

Spark: 
Apache Spark is a fast, distributed data processing engine used to process large-scale data across many machines.
If Hadoop is about storing and batch processing, Spark is about fast processing.
process huge datasets
run analytics and transformations
do this in memory, not just from disk

Spark architecture (high level)
Main components
Driver – the brain (creates jobs, plans execution)
Cluster Manager – allocates resources (YARN, Kubernetes, Standalone)
Executors – workers that actually process data
