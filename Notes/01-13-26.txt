Data - Content Without any  meaning
Information - Data with meaning 
Data Governance - It’s a set of rules, processes, and responsibilities that make sure data is accurate, secure, consistent, and used the right way.
-Types of data and examples:-
1. Structured Data - data in rows and columns used in Machine learning
2. Unstructured data -pdf,images- Deep learnig applications
3. Semi-Structured Data - json files

ETL and ELT:-
Both ETL and ELT are ways to move and prepare data for analysis.
The difference is when the data is transformed.

ETL (Extract → Transform → Load)
What it means:
Data is cleaned and transformed first, then loaded into the target system.
Flow
Extract – get data from sources (databases, APIs, files)
Transform – clean, filter, aggregate, apply business rules
Load – store the final data in a data warehouse

When ETL is used
Traditional data warehouses
When target systems have limited compute power
When only clean, structured data should be stored
Example
Raw sales data → remove duplicates → convert currency → load into warehouse

ELT (Extract → Load → Transform)
What it means:
Raw data is loaded first, then transformed inside the target system.
Flow
Extract – get data from sources
Load – load raw data into the warehouse or data lake
Transform – clean and process data using warehouse tools

When ELT is used
Cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
Large volumes of data
When flexibility and scalability are needed
Example
Raw sales data → load into Snowflake → SQL transforms inside Snowflake

Bronze, Silver, Gold layers:-
They are layers in a data architecture (mostly used in ELT, but can exist with ETL too) that organize data from raw → refined → business-ready.
- Bronze Layer (Raw Data):- First landing zone for data
Raw, unprocessed data
Same format as source system
- Silver Layer (Cleaned & Enriched Data) :-
Cleaned and standardized data
Structured and reliable
- Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data) :-
Final, analytics-ready data
Aggregated and optimized

-A CI/CD pipeline automates code integration, testing, and deployment to ensure fast, reliable, and consistent releases.
